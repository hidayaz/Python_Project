# Python_Project
# A python program I had to make during a course.
# This program takes websites and scans them for some attributes, like an encodying type and if the site is redirecting or not
# You can add / remove websites to / from the database.
# You can add / remove description to website on the database.
# The program has an Admin Panel that requires a password to log in, pass: "admin"
# In order to remove a website you must call them by their name, example: "https://github.com/"
# This is the first ever program I have made completely from zero, and I had to make it for a python course I was going through and finished successfully.
